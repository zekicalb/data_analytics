This exercise is designed to introduce the concepts and techniques of image processing, 
clustering, and segmentation using Python. The tasks are intended to guide you through the 
process of downloading, manipulating, and analyzing an image, ultimately segmenting it into 
distinct regions based on color information. 


Tasks: 

1.) Use Google image search to find a .jpg image of an arbitrary landscape (size < 500 KB).

2.) Read and reshape the image into a 2D array of pixels and RGB colors.

3.) Use the Elbow method to find the optimal number of clusters k for image segmentation.

4.) Perform image segmentation using k-means clustering and visualize the result.
