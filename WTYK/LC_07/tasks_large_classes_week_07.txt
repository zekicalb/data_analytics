The purpose of this exercise is to develop and practice statistical analysis skills, specifically in the context 
of hypothesis testing using the Chi-squared test and correlation analysis using the Pearson correlation 
coefficient. The tasks are designed to familiarize you with essential concepts in categorical and numerical 
data analysis, as well as the use of Python for performing these analyses.

Tasks:

1.) Look at the following contingency table which shows the number of men and women buying different types of pets.

 	     dog  cat  bird
    men	 207  282  241
  women	 234  242  232
  
	a) Define a null- and alternative hypothesis for a Chi-squared test.
	b) Define a significance-level alpha for the Chi-squared test.
	c) Perform a Chi-squared test with Python to test, whether the two categorical variables (gender & type of pets) are independent.
	d) Interpret the test results

2.) Perform a correlation analysis
    
	a) Simulate numerical data
	b) Calculate a Pearson correlation coefficient (r)
	c) Provide a p-value for the Pearson correlation coefficient (r)
