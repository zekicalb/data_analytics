This exercise is designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to classification modeling, 
data simulation, and model evaluation using decision trees and random forests. The tasks will 
help you understand how to generate synthetic data, fit and visualize classification models, 
and evaluate their performance using cross-validation. Additionally, you will learn how to 
interpret and visualize feature importance, which is crucial for understanding the contributions 
of different features to the model's predictions.

Tasks: 

1.) Generate a data frame with 4000 pets with:
    - nominal target variable with 4 classes: 'dog', 'cat', 'fish', 'bird'
    - the data must include five features: age, color, weight, height, eats meat (yes/no)
	- Ask ChatGPT for help to generate the data.

2.) Create train and test data (80% train, 20 test).

3.) Fit a classification tree model and visualize the model.

4.) Use cross-validation to evaluate the model performance.

5.) Fit a random forest classification model.

6.) Show the feature importance in a bar chart.
