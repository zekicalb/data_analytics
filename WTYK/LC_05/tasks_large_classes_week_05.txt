This exercise is focused on developing skills in geographic information systems (GIS) 
and 3D visualization using Google Earth Pro and external tools like OpenRouteService. 

Task:

1.) Install Google Earth Pro Desktop on your computer.
    
2.) Open the cube.kml example from Moodle in Google Earth Pro
    -> Materials for exercises -> Exercises in small classes -> Geodata -> cube.kml

3.) Create a route (with start address ... destination address) by using openroutservice
    -> https://maps.openrouteservice.org/#/place/@6.1962890625,53.291489065300226,5

	a) Save the route as .kml file
	b) Open the route in Google Earth Pro
	c) Format the route in Google Earth Pro (color, thickness, height above ground)
	d) Create a tour and drive the route virtually (camera angle 80 degrees, speed 400 km/h)
