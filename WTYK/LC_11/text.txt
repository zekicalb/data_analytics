According to widespread belief, the Currywurst originated in Berlin in the post-World War II era. The restaurateur Herta Heuwer, who operated a snack stand at the corner of Kant and Kaiser-Friedrich Streets in the Charlottenburg district of Berlin since the summer of 1949, claimed to have invented the typical Currywurst sauce on September 4, 1949. She served it with grilled sausage, thus claiming to have invented the Currywurst. She later adorned her business with slogans like '1st Currywurst Grill in the World' and 'A Berlin specialty invented by us' and registered the word-image trademark 'Chillup' for her sauce in 1959 – a combination of chili and ketchup, recorded on January 21, 1959, based on the application from February 21, 1958, under the number 721319 as a trademark for 'Special Sauce' in the German Patent Office's register. Heuwer incorrectly referred to it as a 'patent.' The company Kraft (→ Mondelēz) reportedly, according to Heuwer, unsuccessfully sought her recipe and trademark rights. Throughout her life, Heuwer insisted that she had not used ketchup or a ready-made spice mix but instead mixed the sauce with tomato paste and carefully seasoned it with individual spices. In her old age, she made several television appearances and celebrated herself as the 'inventor of the Currywurst.' The German Currywurst Museum, opened in Berlin in 2009 and existing until December 2018, followed this perspective. On June 29, 2003, a memorial plaque in honor of Herta Heuwer was unveiled at the former location of her snack stand (→ Kantstraße 101; now an Asian supermarket) by the then district mayor Monika Thiemen.

However, Heuwer cannot entirely claim the development of the Currywurst for herself. On the one hand, certain details of her account do not seem plausible. She wanted to remember precisely that on September 4, 1949, when she first mixed her sauce, it was raining heavily, whereas according to weather records, it was a dry day. On the other hand, the role of the butcher Max Brückner from Johanngeorgenstadt in the Ore Mountains must be considered. After the end of the war, he came to West Berlin, founded a company in Berlin-Spandau with some employees from his hometown, and had developed a self-designed process for making sausage without casing, which became known as 'Spandauer ohne Pelle' (Spandau without skin). In the early 1950s, he joined forces with Frank Friedrich, also from the Ore Mountains. The company they built, Maximilian, still exists. On older versions of the website, detailed representations of the company's history and collaboration with Herta Heuwer were found. According to this, Heuwer's 'first sauce creations' in 1949 did not lead to great success. It was only together with Frank Friedrich that she developed the final recipe, which she sold at her snack stand from then on. However, this presentation emphasizes that the Currywurst as a dish was Heuwer's invention because the idea of adding sauce was hers.

'Did Herta Heuwer invent the Currywurst? There are no doubts today that she did. The connection between casing-free 'Spandauer ohne Pelle' and her idea to combine it with her own seasoning sauce, a ketchup, is clearly her idea. For the taste success, however, in coordination with Herta Heuwer, Frank Friedrich, the present-day senior and former junior partner of the company founder Max Brückner, is responsible, who was in charge of the final taste coordination of the sausage and the sauce.'

The success of Brückner's sausage without casing/skin was attributed to the post-war emergency situation. Natural casing was scarce after World War II. In sausage production, the filling (meat/fat mixture) is pressed into a casing and solidifies there to give the sausage its shape. With Brückner's manufacturing method, the sausage without casing obtained its form. The first customer was the Jankowitz family from Spandau. The 'Spandauer ohne Pelle,' along with the popular tomato sauce (following Herta Heuwer's example), was well-received. Later, when other snack sellers sold this sausage, the name 'Currywurst ohne Darm' (Currywurst without casing) prevailed.
