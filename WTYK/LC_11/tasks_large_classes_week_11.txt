The purpose of this exercise is to enhance your understanding of word embeddings, a key concept in natural 
language processing (NLP), by providing hands-on experience with neural network models in a Jupyter notebook 
environment. The exercise focuses on the practical application of word embeddings rather than the theoretical 
details of neural networks, making it accessible even if neural networks are not a primary focus of your studies.

Tasks: 

1.) The exercises in this large class are designed to deepen understanding of the word embedding concept.
    The example shows how neural networks can be used to train models for word embeddings and predictions 
    of target words of a text corpus. Note that knowledge about the functionality of neural networks 
    is not part of the written exam.

2.) Try to run the Jupyter notebook and understand what the Python code is doing.

3.) Learn how text data is prepared, and how neural networks can be used to create word embeddings and to predict
    target words based on continuous bag-of-words (CBOW).
