This exercise is designed to help you practice data simulation, visualization using 
boxplots, and statistical analysis using ANOVA. 

Task:

1.) Simulate data (dataframe with three columns) with smartphone brands, type and prices.
    The data must contain three different smartphone brands and realistic prices per brand.

2.) Create a graphic with grouped boxplots to show how prices vary per brand.

3.) Use Anlysis of Variance (ANOVA) to investigate whether prices differ between groups
    For this, define a statistical Hypothesis and a suitable significance level alpha (Î±).
